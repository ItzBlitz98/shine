This is an extensions that is on Google chrome extension website. The app was sold and the new owner decided to inject cookies and shit in to the app, like a scube. So I downloaded the extension before he sold it, and got the code so we don't have to worry.


# Installation

1. Download the repo and create a folder on your desktop and drag the files over
2. In chrome, go to Tools > More tools > Extensions
3. There should be a button saying "Load unpacked extension"
4. Select your folder that you created and it should build the extension
